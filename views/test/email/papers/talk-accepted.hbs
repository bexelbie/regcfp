Your Flock submission "{{paper.title}}" has been accepted!

Hello,

We have accepted your submission, "{{paper.title}}" for Flock this year.
We are excited to have you participate in Flock!  Below are some details
you will need to know.

=Presentations=
If you are giving a Talk, you will have 50 minutes per session. You can
use all of this for your presentation if you wish, but we strongly
advise that you leave 10-15 minutes for Question & Answers. We want to
leave enough time between sessions for hallway discussions and bathroom
breaks.

If you are giving a Workshop, Hackfest, or Sprint, you will have 2 hours
for your session. You can use those two hours however you see fit,
slides, open hacking, whatever. However, you will need to clear
the room by the end of the two hour mark, so plan accordingly.

== Laptops ==
Please come prepared to use your personal laptop to present with. If you
know this is going to be a problem, let us know. We strongly prefer that
you not be presenting on Windows or Mac OSX. If you do not have a Linux
instance on your laptop (or you do not have a laptop), let us know, and
we will make arrangements for a loaner laptop to be
used.

Also, try not to update your system the night before your session. This
never ends well. :)

= Financial Assistance =
Flock has a limited pool of funding available to cover travel and
lodging for accepted speakers.  If you requested funding, that will be
handled as soon as possible and you will be contacted separately.

= Invitation Letters =
If you need an invitation letter in order to secure a visa to the United
States, please email flock-staff@fedoraproject.org.

= Cancellation =
If you cannot attend Flock, please let us know as soon as possible.

= Schedule =
The full schedule will be available on https://flocktofedora.org when it
is complete.

On behalf of the Flock paper committee, congratulations again!
